# Assembly Repository

This repository contains an assembly language project, specifically a **MenuApplication**. The project is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts of assembly programming through a menu-driven interface.

## Features

- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Provides a user-friendly menu to interact with various functionalities.
- **Assembly Language Implementation**: Offers insight into low-level programming and system operations.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrei2308/Assembly.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Assembly/MenuApplication
   ```

3. **Assemble the source code**:

   Use an assembler compatible with the project's assembly language (e.g., NASM for x86 assembly) to assemble the source files.

4. **Link the object files**:

   Link the assembled object files to create an executable.

5. **Run the executable**:

   Execute the generated binary to start the application.

## Prerequisites

- **Assembler**: An assembler compatible with the project's assembly language (e.g., NASM for x86 assembly).
- **Linker**: A linker to create executable files from object files.
- **Operating System**: A system capable of running assembly language programs (e.g., Linux for NASM-assembled programs).
